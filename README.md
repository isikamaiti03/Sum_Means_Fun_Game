This is a simple command-line game written in C where players practice basic addition with randomly generated numbers. The game has three difficulty levels, and the player's score is based on their performance.

How the Game Works

Difficulty Levels:
     Beginner: Adds two random numbers                 between 1 and 500.
     Medium: Adds two random numbers                 between 501 and 50,000.
     Pro: Adds two random numbers                 between 50,001 and 500,000.

Gameplay:
The game starts by asking the player to choose a difficulty level.
Two random numbers are then generated based on the selected level.
The player must input the correct sum of these two numbers.
If the answer is correct, the player earns 5 points. If incorrect, they lose 5 points.
The game can be played multiple times, and the total score is displayed at the end.

Score:
The score is calculated based on correct or incorrect answers.
The final score is displayed when the player decides to stop playing.
